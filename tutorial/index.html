            <b>Abstract: </b><br />
            Due to the pervasive adoption of the ubiquitous cloud, distributive grid and mobile computing, data collection has grown exponentially in every industry, research area, and government sector. Making sense and managing the life cycle of big data becomes a very complex topic. For instance, the use of Web 2.0 technologies and applications, in particular social media, has efficiently gathered a large volume of timely feedback and opinions from a diverse, global population (Fan and Gordon, 2014). In fact, data about people, their behaviors and communications, and the events they experience can be processed and used to detect population trends, predict behavior and inform decisions (Ribarsky et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2012). This tutorial will introduce participants to Splunk, a commercial software tool used to search, monitor and analyze big data, to give participants an opportunity to engage with data analytical tools and complete hands-on exercises. The hands-on exercises will start with an introduction to an experimental big data set, followed by a discussion about the nature of data and some analysis perspectives and techniques. These exercises will allow participants to identify and quantify the domains of specific research areas (e.g., anonymized healthcare, social, or business data) using a “big data” set that addresses their research questions. Participants will be placed in groups where they will perform an analysis on a prepared data set. Each group will have a different analytical focus. This analysis will require participants to parse out probable variables and make comparison and inference about users’ behavioral patterns and/or motivation models as displayed by actors collectively. Participants will be invited to demonstrate their findings and share their views after the completion of these hands-on exercises.

            Technology Requirements: Participants are required to bring their own laptops. Please download and install Splunk prior to the tutorial: <a href="http://dev.splunk.com/page/developer_license_sign_up">http://dev.splunk.com/page/developer_license_sign_up</a>

            <h3>Behavioral Mining, Cultural Differences and Social Network Analysis in Massive Online Games</h3>

            Abstract:
            Massive Online Games (MOGs) refer to massive online persistent environments (World of Warcraft, EVE Online, EverQuest etc) shared by millions of people . In general these environments are characterized by a rich array of activities and social interactions with a wide array of behaviors e.g., cooperation, trade, quest, deceit, mentoring etc. Such environments allow one to study human behavior at a level of granularity where it was not possible to do so previously. Given the challenges associated with analyzing this type of data traditional techniques in data mining and social network analysis have to be extended with insights from the social sciences. The tutorial will cover predictive and generative models in the study of MOGs. Additionally we will cover some SNA techniques which are more appropriate for MOGs given the multi-dimensionality of the data (P*/ERGM Models, IR Based Network Analysis, Hypergrah based Techniques, Coextensive Social Networks etc). Based on our published work in this area we also describe the various ways in which MOGs exhibit similarities to the real world e.g., economic behaviors, clandestine behaviors, mentoring etc). Lastly we describe the scope and limitations of analysis of MOGs based on limitations in data collection, availability and ethical concerns. An overview of differences in human behavior between Chinese and American MMOs is also given.

            David Broniatowski, Ph.D., Director of the Decision Making and Systems Architecture Laboratory, conducts research in decision making under risk, group decision making, system architecture, and behavioral epidemiology. This research program draws upon a wide range of techniques including formal mathematical modeling, experimental design, automated text analysis and natural language processing, social and technical network analysis, and big data. Current projects include a text network analysis of transcripts from the US Food and Drug Administration's Circulatory Systems Advisory Panel meetings, a mathematical formalization of Fuzzy Trace Theory -- a leading theory of decision-making under risk, derivation of metrics for flexibility and controllability for complex engineered socio-technical systems, and using Twitter data to conduct surveillance of influenza infection and the resulting social response.

            <h3>Introduction to social network and spatial data in R and Python to social scientists</h3>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="span6">
        <p>
            <b>Abstract:</b><br/> 
            I introduce the effective collection, organization and exploration of spatial data (maps) and social network data to social scientists. Detailed templates in Python and R will be shared that automate the processes mentioned above. A particular emphasis will be given to data collected from the web, the visualization of data in networks and/or maps. I finally present steps for publication of reports via the tools offered in Python (IPython and Github) and R (RStudio, Github and RPubs), including brief explanations on how interact with UCINET, Gephi, Netlogo and QGIS. 
        </p>
